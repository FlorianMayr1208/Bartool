## 📱 Mobile UX Improvements

### Touch Target Optimization
**Before**: Small chips and controls hard to tap accurately
**After**: Minimum 44px touch targets following mobile guidelines

### Filter Controls
**Before**: Desktop-oriented buttons and sliders
**After**: Mobile-optimized controls with better spacing and labels

### Layout Responsiveness
**Before**: Single column layout with cramped controls
**After**: Responsive grid that adapts to screen size

### Drag & Drop Experience
**Before**: Desktop-only drag and drop functionality
**After**: Touch-optimized drag with visual and haptic feedback

## 🎨 Visual Design Enhancements

### Touch Feedback
- **Press animations**: Scale down on touch for immediate feedback
- **Drag states**: Visual indicators when dragging items
- **Hover transitions**: Smooth scaling and shadow effects
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during interactions

### Responsive Typography
```css
text-sm sm:text-base           /* Adaptive text sizing */
px-3 py-2 sm:px-4 sm:py-3     /* Responsive padding */
min-h-[40px] sm:min-h-[44px]  /* Adaptive touch targets */
```

### Mobile Layout Grid
```css
grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2     /* Responsive filter sections */
grid-cols-3 gap-2 sm:flex     /* Adaptive button layouts */
flex-col sm:flex-row          /* Mobile-first header */
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Custom Hooks
